# Advanced rebasing

Beyond re-applying your commit on another base, `rebase` offers an interactive mode, allowing you to edit each commit as it is re-applied and effectively rewriting the git history however you want. This includes:

* Squash multiple commits into a single one
* Move commits inside the history
* Split commits into multiple
* Edit commits
* ...and more!

So hold your breath, we'll do all of these in one rebase!
